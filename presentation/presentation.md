# Project and Presentation

An essential component of this course involves delving deep into several papers related to specific research topics. This task is to be completed in pairs. While the choice of paper is based on your interests, it must relate to the theoretical foundations of deep learning. You are encouraged to consult with instructors and TAs when selecting your paper.

* **Proposal Submission**: By the 1st of Azar, 1402, you are required to submit a 1-page proposal outlining your chosen research topic.

* **Presentation**: During the final two weeks of the course, you will deliver a 20-minute presentation to succinctly summarize the research paper.

* **Paper Review**: You are expected to submit a concise review of the paper. This review should provide an overview of the paper, its motivation, and the important theoretical results of the work. Additionally, critically evaluate its strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, you are encouraged (although it is optional) to further explore the results or implement the ideas and compare them with other findings.
