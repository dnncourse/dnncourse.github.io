A crucial aspect of the course involves engaging in discussions about several papers pertaining to specific research topics.  This task is to be completed in pairs. While the choice of paper is influenced by your individual interests, it must pertain to the theoretical foundations of deep learning. Please don't hesitate to seek guidance from the course instructors and TAs when selecting your paper.

Proposal Submission: By Azar 1, 1402, you are required to submit a 1-page proposal outlining your chosen research topic.

Presentation: During the final two weeks of the course, you will deliver a 20-minute presentation to succinctly summarize the research paper.

Paper Review: You are expected to submit a concise review of the paper. In this review, provide an overview of the paper the motivation and important theoretical results of the work. Also,  critically evaluate its strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, you are encouraged (though optional) to further explore the results or implement the ideas and compare them with other findings.
