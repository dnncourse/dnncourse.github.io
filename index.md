# Deep Learning
{: .mb-2 .text-green-000}

Department of Mathematics, Sharif University. Fall 2023
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This course provides an introductory exploration of deep learning theory, employing mathematical tools as a foundation. In the initial section, we revisit the core principles that underpin deep learning. Later in the course, our attention shifts towards delving into the theoretical underpinnings of deep neural networks


#Prerequisites
The following skills will be useful for success in this course:

* Machine Learning: Some familiarity with machine learning will be helpful but not required; we will review important concepts that are needed for this course.

* Programming: You should be comfortable programming in Python. You should be familiar with algorithms and data structures. Familiarity with numpy or similar frameworks for numeric programming will be helpful but is not strictly required.

* Probability: You should have been exposed to probability distributions, random variables, expectations, etc.

## Course Work
Grading will be based:
* Assignments (?)
* Final Exam (?)
* Paper Presentation (25%): All students taking a

Presentations
A crucial aspect of the course involves engaging in discussions about several papers pertaining to specific research topics.  This task is to be completed in pairs. While the choice of paper is influenced by your individual interests, it must pertain to the theoretical foundations of deep learning. Please don't hesitate to seek guidance from the course instructors and TAs when selecting your paper.

Proposal Submission: By Azar 1, 1402, you are required to submit a 1-page proposal outlining your chosen research topic.

Presentation: During the final two weeks of the course, you will deliver a 20-minute presentation to succinctly summarize the research paper.

Paper Review: You are expected to submit a concise review of the paper. In this review, provide an overview of the paper the motivation and important theoretical results of the work. Also,  critically evaluate its strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, you are encouraged (though optional) to further explore the results or implement the ideas and compare them with other findings.
